# Retro Dynamics
Retro Dynamics is an attempt to create a component-based game engine in C.

## Why?
Mostly just for fun, but it could also be somewhat useful. C can be pretty darn fast when used properly, and "pretty darn fast" would be a great property for a game engine. It's also nice because C is basically the lowest level above assembler, so it's possible that a C based game engine could be utilized by basically any higher-level language.
